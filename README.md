<a href="https://www.amazonicas.org/mainconferences.php">AMAZONICAS Winter Course</a>
* Cartography PC Room, Department of Anthropology, Universidad de los Andes
* Tuesday 13 June - Friday 16 June (3 hrs/day) : precise times to be announced
* Instruction mostly in English, with Spanish translation available
* Course materials available in English, Spanish, and Portuguese
* Please bring your own computer!
* If you'd like to bring language data, it should be a simple text file (.txt format)

Participants in this course will learn how to build several language-related tools, including a predictive text system, a spell checker, and some word games. For those students without previous programming experience, we will also teach some basics of the Python programming language. Along the way, you will also learn a few principles of computational linguistics, and you’ll learn a lot about working with language data computationally!

We will present a series of tutorials illustrating how to build these tools and make a small website so that other people can use your tools. You can work with data that we provide, or with data from a language that you are interested in. We do not assume any previous background with Python or with computer programming. Please bring your own computer. The course will run for 4 days, with a 3-hour course session each day.

To work with your own data, you will need textual data in a simple text file. If we have the time, we should be able to help with any questions about how to get the data into the right format.
